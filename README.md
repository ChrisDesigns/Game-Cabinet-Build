The Game Cabinet Build was a final product for my junior level programming class. We had a 4 man team, consisting of a graphic designer, cabinet builder, programmer and management. The name of the game was "Portal to Your World" and is a plat-former where you must escape from portal to portal through different galaxies to return home.
